## Why and How?

Are you fan of the Pomodoro technique? Us too! However, many existing apps lack the flexibility, locking users into strict routines :(

Unlike its counterparts, Flow Timer is an adaptable assistant, which will not only remind you to have a rest in time, but will also adjust break time based on your actual work duration, freeing you from rigid timeframes and allowing to work as long as you feel being in the zone!
Setup is easy - choose preferred Pomodoro timer duration and set desired number of rest minutes per hour of work. For beginning or ending your work and rest segments, simply use respective buttons.
With Flow Timer, productivity bends to your rhythm, not the other way around!
